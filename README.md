# Find Movie or Series details
# This project uses omdb api to fetch details of movies/series whatever the user search for and it then displays the fetched content on screen.
# Have used the following-
# HTML5
# CSS3
# Bootstrap
# Bootwatch
# Javascript 
# JQuery

*I have also used Axios that is a Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which can be used in our front-end application and in our Node. js backend. Axios makes it easier to send asynchronous HTTP request to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations.
